# Train-Scheduler

App Instructions

This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

You can also add trains, by submitting the following:
  Train Name
  Destination 
  First Train Time -- (HH:mm military time)
  Frequency -- minutes

This app will calculate when the next train will arrive; which is relative to the current time at the top of the app.
